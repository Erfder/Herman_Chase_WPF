<h2>Calculating to see whether it would be beneficial to send an employee on break or not.</h2>
<p>For this calculation we are assuming other costs (materials, upkeep, etc) have already been taken out of sales numbers.</p>
<p>So in other words this would be the last step in profit calculation, using only labor.</p>
<h5>Enter the dollar amount of sales last hour and the expected dollar amount of sales this hour (no $ symbols).</h5>
<input type = "text" id = "1" value = "Expected sales">
<input type = "text" id = "2" value = "Sales last hour">
<h5>Enter the number of employees working right now and the average wage</h5>
<input type = "text" id = "N" value = "Number of workers">  <!-- these are a place to enter values that aren't annoying popup prompts. Can also be reused without refreshing.-->
<input type = "text" id = "P" value = "Average Pay">
